# Install and Run Android Applications

You can install Android applications from the command line.

```bash
waydroid app install xyz.apk
```

The apk files you will sometimes find on the internet tend to only have arm support, and will therefore not work on x86\_64.

You may want to install [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) to get applications graphically. Note that the Google Play Store will not work as is, because it relies on the proprietary Google Play Services, which are not installed.
