# Ubuntu/Debian Based Install Instructions

## Installation:

These instructions work for ubuntu focal, ubuntu hirsute, debian bullseye, droidian, ubports, and likely more. We will continue to update this document as the project further develops

### Prerequisites

Waydroid requires the following in order to work properly on your PC:

* python3
* lxc
* curl
* Wayland session manager _**!MPORTANT!!**_

_**NOTICE**: Most mobile distros will require the user to remount as read-write before Waydroid can init properly._ 

### Install

Add the repo to your sources.list

* **Unified Install** _\(for droidian & ubports, this step can be skipped\)_ Replace `DISTRO="bullseye"` with your current target. Options: **focal**, **bullseye**, **hirsute**

```bash
export DISTRO="bullseye" && \
curl https://repo.waydro.id/waydroid.gpg > /usr/share/keyrings/waydroid.gpg && \ 
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/waydroid.gpg] https://repo.waydro.id/ $DISTRO main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/waydroid.list && \
sudo apt update
```

* **Desktop Distros**  


  **install Waydroid:**

  ```bash
  apt install waydroid
  ```

  **And start the init process:**

  ```bash
  sudo waydroid init
  ```

  **Then start the waydroid-container service:**

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start waydroid-containerNOTICE
  ```

* **Mobile Distros**  
  \(for Droidian & ubports, this step is where you start\)

  For mobile distros, you can start Waydroid by running:exit: Ctrl+â†©

  ```text
  sudo -s
  apt update
  apt install waydroid
  waydroid init
  start waydroid
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Manually Starting Waydroid

To start Waydroid without systemctl, you need to follow a few simple steps

**Start the container first:**

```bash
sudo waydroid container start
```

**And in a new terminal tab, start the waydroid session:**

```bash
waydroid session start
```

After that starts and you see "Android with user 0 is ready", it is safe to launch an app from the applications menu, or 

### Launch Waydroid In Full-Screen Mode:

_\(This can be run while Waydroid is running, or used to start it in full-screen mode\)_

```bash
waydroid show-full-ui
```

### Launch Waydroid In Multi-Window Mode:

First we need to set the property while a Waydroid session is running:

```bash
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.multi_windows true
```

After that, we can restart the container:

```text
sudo systemctl restart waydroid-container
```

Then we are ready to launch an app, and it will start in multi-window mode

## Reinstalling Waydroid

Sometimes things don't go as planned and you need to remove it all and start over. To do that, follow the steps below:

First, make sure you have stopped the session and containers:

```bash
waydroid session stop
sudo waydroid container stop
```

Then it is safe to remove Waydroid:

```bash
sudo apt remove waydroid
```

After you remove Waydroid, reboot.

Then once logged back in, we need to do a little cleanup:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/waydroid /home/.waydroid ~/waydroid
```

Then can reinstall and run the init command again:

```bash
sudo apt install waydroid
sudo waydroid init
```
